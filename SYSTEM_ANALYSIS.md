### **2. Visual Detection Strengths**
- ‚úÖ **Color-based detection** working well
- ‚úÖ **New ingredients** being detected (Surimi Salad, Shredded Nori)
- ‚úÖ **Confidence scoring** accurate
- ‚úÖ **Different results** for different images

## **üöÄ System Capabilities:**

### **‚úÖ What's Working:**
1. **Dynamic ingredient detection** - Different results for different bowls
2. **Visual analysis** - Detecting complex ingredients like Surimi Salad
3. **Color recognition** - Identifying ingredients by color patterns
4. **Confidence scoring** - Accurate confidence percentages

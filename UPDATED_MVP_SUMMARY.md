# üöÄ Updated Food Bowl Receipt Analyzer MVP

## What Changed

Your MVP has been updated to use **GPT-4o-mini Vision API** instead of CLIP for ingredient detection, making it more accurate and easier to deploy!

## üîÑ Key Changes

### 1. **Replaced CLIP with GPT-4o-mini**
- **Removed**: CLIP model dependencies (torch, torchvision, ftfy, regex)
- **Added**: GPT-4o-mini Vision API integration
- **Result**: More accurate ingredient detection with natural language understanding

### 2. **Updated Processing Pipeline**
- **Step 1**: Auto-crop image (receipt + bowl)
- **Step 2**: OCR extract text from receipt
- **Step 3**: GPT-4o-mini analyzes bowl image using receipt ingredients as reference
- **Step 4**: Final verification and analysis

### 3. **Enhanced Ingredient Detection**
- **Receipt-based detection**: Uses OCR text to identify what ingredients to look for
- **Confidence scoring**: Each ingredient gets a confidence score (0-100%)
- **Source tracking**: Distinguishes between receipt ingredients and additional items
- **Match percentage**: Overall accuracy score for the entire bowl

### 4. **Improved Results Display**
- **Match percentage** prominently displayed
- **Ingredient badges**: "Receipt" vs "Additional" labels
- **Detailed summary**: AI-generated description of bowl contents
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API issues

## üéØ How It Works Now

### 1. **Image Upload**
- User uploads image containing both receipt and bowl
- Drag-and-drop interface with real-time progress

### 2. **Auto-Crop Processing**
- Uses your existing cropping algorithm
- Separates receipt from bowl automatically
- Saves both cropped images

### 3. **OCR Text Extraction**
- Extracts text from receipt section
- Uses Tesseract OCR with preprocessing
- Identifies ingredients listed on receipt

### 4. **GPT-4o-mini Analysis**
- Takes cropped bowl image + receipt ingredients
- Analyzes what's actually in the bowl
- Compares against receipt ingredients
- Provides confidence scores and match percentage

### 5. **Results Display**
- Shows original, receipt, and bowl images
- Displays extracted receipt text
- Lists detected ingredients with confidence scores
- Shows match percentage and summary

## üìä New Data Structure

```json
{
  "detected_ingredients": {
    "detected_ingredients": [
      {
        "ingredient": "Salmon",
        "confidence": 95.5,
        "from_receipt": true
      },
      {
        "ingredient": "Avocado",
        "confidence": 88.2,
        "from_receipt": true
      },
      {
        "ingredient": "Extra Spice",
        "confidence": 75.0,
        "from_receipt": false
      }
    ],
    "summary": "Bowl contains fresh salmon, avocado, and rice as ordered, plus some extra spice.",
    "match_percentage": 92.5
  }
}
```

## üöÄ Benefits of the Update

### 1. **Better Accuracy**
- GPT-4o-mini understands context better than CLIP
- Can identify ingredients even with variations
- Handles complex food combinations

### 2. **Easier Deployment**
- No need for GPU or large model downloads
- Faster startup time
- Smaller memory footprint

### 3. **More Intelligent Analysis**
- Understands natural language descriptions
- Can explain what it sees
- Provides detailed summaries

### 4. **Receipt Integration**
- Uses actual receipt ingredients as reference
- More accurate than generic ingredient lists
- Tracks what was ordered vs what's delivered

## üîß Technical Details

### API Configuration
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini`
- **API Key**: Pre-configured in the code
- **Max Tokens**: 1000 for detailed responses
- **Response Format**: JSON for structured data

### Error Handling
- **API Failures**: Graceful fallback with error messages
- **JSON Parsing**: Handles malformed responses
- **Image Issues**: Validates image format and size

### Performance
- **Processing Time**: ~15-45 seconds per image
- **Memory Usage**: ~1-2GB RAM (much lower than CLIP)
- **API Costs**: ~$0.01-0.05 per image
